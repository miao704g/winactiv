# Winactiv has been ARCHIVED
## What does this mean?
- This means that I'm stopping Winactiv development in favor of a new, cleaner, better ***program***, yes, Winactiv is coming back uner a new name and as an open source ***PROGRAM***!



# What is it for?
Winactiv is a simple batch script that can (as of time of writing) activate some Volume Windows 10/8.1/8 editions
# Who is it for?
Wnactiv is a dummy-proof tool for people that are new to computers
# How to use it
Just run the script and press about two buttons
# Can't I just use KMSpico?
You can, but Winactiv has some advantages over KMSpico, some examples:
- It's fully open source, anyone can make their own Winactiv version and since it's a script it's incredibly easy to check the code for fishy stuff
- It's very lightweight and could fit on a floppy disk
- It WON'T get detected as a virus, meaning less trouble to actually run it
- Overall less fishy stuff is happening

However, KMSpico DOES have some advantages over Winactiv:
- KMSpico automatically renews kms activation
- KMSpico can activate Office
- If you're an experienced user, KMSpico is overall better 
- It's definetly more polished than Winactiv
